  1/ do unset PATH -> create a script named ls -> do ls (possibly differs from bash)

  2/ do unset PWD -> do cd .. (possible segfault)

  3/ do & (possible brick)

  4/ do cat -e <<test <<tes <<te  <infile >out1 >out2 | grep a <<pomme >out3 (possibly differs from bash)

  5/ launch minishell with env -i in front of it (possible segfault)

  6/ do *any builtin* | ls (possible leak)

  7/ do *any directory in cwd* with arguments (possible leak) / do *

  8/ do echo test$USER+$PWD / do echo $1fdfsdfsdfsdf / do $'' / do $"" (possibly differs from bash)

  9/ do >out1 | >out2 / do <<test | <<test1 (possible everything)

  10/ do *any directory in cwd* (possible leak)

  11/ do *random non-existing command* | *anything you want* (possible leak)

  12/ try signals in blocking commands and in heredocs (possibly differs from bash)

  13/ do echo -nnnnnnnnnnnn -nn -nn test -> should display test without a \n (possibly differs from bash)

  14/ try expanding env variables in heredoc (possibly differs from bash)

  15/ create a simlink directory and put its name as a command (possible leak)

  16/ create an executable named ..ls in /bin and do ..ls

  17/ do ls > $MOHA -> should say ambigous redirect
